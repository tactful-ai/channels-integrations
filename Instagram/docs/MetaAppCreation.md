# Meta App Creation

The app creation flow gathers the minimum amount of information needed to generate a unique ID for our app. Once we complete the flow we will end up in the App Dashboard where we can provide additional information about our app, or start [building and testing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test) right away.

# Step 1: Start the app creation process

If we just came from the registration flow, click the **Create First App** button.

Otherwise, go to the [Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps)  panel and click **Create App**.

# Step 2: Choose a use case

Our use case determines which permissions, products and APIs are available to our app.

Select a use case and click **Next**.

If we select **Other**, meaning we want to implement ads, gaming, or messaging, perhaps in addition to Facebook Login, we’ll be redirected to the [App Types creation flow (see below)](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/#app-type).

# Step 3: Select your app name and email

We enter the name of our app and an email address where meta can send us any important developer notifications. The email address can be different from the email address associated with our Facebook account, just make sure it's valid and that we monitor it, since all important developer notifications will be sent there. We can also add a Meta Business Account if we have one, then click **Create App**.

Once we have completed the app creation flow, our app will be loaded in our app dashboard. The app dashboard allows us to view, add, and update details, such as app settings, roles, and additional use cases. We can also request access to the permissions our app will need to make successful API calls to Graph API endpoints for our use cases.

## App Type Creation Flow

If we need to implement more products, such as ads, games, or messaging, in addition to Facebook Login or we do not need Facebook Login, we will select an [app type](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/#)  during the app creation flow instead of a use case.

### Step 1: Choose an app type

Our app type determines which products and APIs are available to our app. If this is our first time creating an app and we are just exploring the app creation flow, we’ll choose the **None** option. Later, when we are more familiar with meta’s products and APIs, we’ll refer to their [app types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard/app-types) document to determine which app type is best suited for our app, then we’ll create a new app and choose an appropriate type.

(**Note**: for our purposes, the most suitable type is indeed **None**, since the Consumer type offers facebook login and instagram basic display, while the business type offers messenger and instagram graph api and we need the best of both worlds so we’ll choose None)

### Step 2: Set your app name and email

Enter the name of our app and an email address where meta can send us any important developer notifications. The email address can be different from the email address associated with our Facebook account, we’ll just make sure it's valid and that we monitor it, since all important developer notifications will be sent there.

We can also add a [Facebook Business Manager account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/113163272211510) if we have one, then click **Create App**.

Once we have completed the app creation flow our app will be loaded in the App Dashboard.
