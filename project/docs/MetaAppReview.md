# Meta App Review Request

# How it Works

App Review consists of two parts: App Verification and Permissions Review. App Verification is where Meta test the app to see whether the app works, follows the use cases described and meets their bar for quality of user experience. Permissions Review is where Meta reviewers evaluate whether the developer has requested only the permissions and features their app needs. We need to pass both evaluations to have our requested permissions and features approved.

# Best Practices

- App review should only be undertaken when our app is fully operational and ready to go live.
- We should know exactly the permissions and features our app requires and be able to describe or even demonstrate how our app functions in accordance with Meta’s platform policy

# Required Details to be Submitted

## App Verification Details

1. Provide the reviewer with the means to access our app. This could be a mobile app package or a URL depending on the type of app.
2. Provide detailed step-by-step instructions on how a reviewer can test our integration and how we are using the requested permissions and features. Include any testing credentials required to test our integration.

## Permissions Review Details

1. Provide a detailed description of how our app uses the permissions or features requested, how it adds value for a person using our app, and why it’s necessary for app functionality.
2. Provide a detailed step-by-step video walkthrough of how our app will use the permissions or features so Meta can confirm it is used correctly and doesn’t violate their policies.

Following a successful submission, business verification may be required before approval. (Note: this is according to Meta’s Developer Guide. However, the platform actually asks for business verification before being able to complete our App Review request.)
